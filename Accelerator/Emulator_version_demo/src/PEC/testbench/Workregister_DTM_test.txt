Test of writing registers and DTM from ALU.

Registers are initialized using DBUS constants and passed value to Y-bus and written to work-register.

W0 = 0x70
W1 = 0x71
W2 = 0x72
W3 = 0x73
W4 = 0x74
W5 = 0x75
W6 = 0x76
W7 = 0x77


Next sequence it to add one to the register value W0-W7 and write the result to DTM.

DTM = 71 00 00 00
DTM = 71 72 00 00
DTM = 71 72 73 00
DTM = 71 72 73 74
DTM = 75 72 73 74
DTM = 75 76 73 74
DTM = 75 76 77 74
DTM = 75 76 77 78

Resulting workregisters are then.

W0 = 0x71
W1 = 0x72
W2 = 0x73
W3 = 0x74
W4 = 0x75
W5 = 0x76
W6 = 0x77
W7 = 0x78
